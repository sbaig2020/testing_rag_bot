# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AI RAG Bot team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **[security@example.com]** (replace with actual contact)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information along with your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Regularly rotate your API keys
   - Monitor API usage for unusual activity

2. **File Upload Security**
   - Only upload trusted documents
   - Be aware that uploaded content is processed by AI models
   - Regularly clean up uploaded files
   - Monitor disk usage

3. **Network Security**
   - Run the application behind a firewall
   - Use HTTPS in production environments
   - Implement proper authentication if exposing publicly
   - Monitor access logs

4. **Data Privacy**
   - Be mindful of sensitive information in documents
   - Understand that document content may be sent to AI providers
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Consider local-only AI models for sensitive data

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regularly audit for known vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Configuration**
   - Use secure defaults
   - Implement proper logging (without sensitive data)
   - Configure appropriate file permissions
   - Use environment-specific configurations

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password policies
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Consider multi-factor authentication

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Model Interactions
- Document content is sent to external AI providers (Anthropic)
- API keys are transmitted over HTTPS
- Responses may include information from training data

### File Processing
- Uploaded files are processed locally
- Text extraction may be vulnerable to malicious documents
- Vector embeddings are stored locally

### Web Interface
- WebSocket connections for real-time chat
- File upload functionality
- Session-based state management

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Updates will be announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- README updates

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Security report received
- **Day 1-2**: Initial response and triage
- **Day 3-7**: Vulnerability assessment and reproduction
- **Day 8-30**: Patch development and testing
- **Day 31**: Public disclosure and patch release

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of initial report.

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we will acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our project documentation and release notes.

## Security Tools and Practices

### Recommended Security Tools

For developers working on this project:

```bash
# Install security audit tools
pip install safety bandit pip-audit

# Run security checks
safety check
bandit -r .
pip-audit

# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Consider using pre-commit hooks for security checks:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
    rev: '1.7.5'
    hooks:
      - id: bandit
        args: ['-r', '.']
  - repo: https://github.com/gitguardian/ggshield
    rev: v1.18.0
    hooks:
      - id: ggshield
        language: python
        stages: [commit]
```
